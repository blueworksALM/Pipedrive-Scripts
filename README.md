# Pipedrive-Scripts

The ```pd_clicked_email.sh``` script will allow you to identify which recipients clicked on the links in emails sent by you.

You will need:
- the ids of the emails, which you can copy-paste from the email Inisghts report on Pipedrive.
- a valid API key, which you can retrieve from your personal account settings.
